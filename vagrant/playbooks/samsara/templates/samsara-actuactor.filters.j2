# Filters
#
# Filters definition files contain lists of filters that nova-rootwrap will use
# to allow or deny a specific command. They are generally suffixed by
# .filters.Since they are in the trusted security path, they need to be owned
# and writeable only by the root user. Their location is specified in the
# rootwrap.conf file.
# It uses an INI file format with a [Filters] section and several lines, each
# with a unique parameter name (different for each filter you define)
# samsara-rootwrap command filters for power states manipulation
# This file should be owned by (and only-writeable by) the root user
