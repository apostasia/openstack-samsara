# NOTE(mikal): this migration number exists like this because change
# I506dd1c8d0f0a877fdfc1a4ed11a8830d9600b98 needs to revert the hyper-v
# keypair change, but we promise that we will never remove a schema migration
# version. Instead, we replace this migration with a noop.
#
# It is hypothetically possible that a hyper-v continuous deployer exists who
# will have a poor experience because of this code revert, if that deployer
# is you, please contact the nova team at openstack-dev@lists.openstack.org
# and we will walk you through the manual fix required for this problem.
